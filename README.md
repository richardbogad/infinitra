## What is INFINITRA?
Have you ever dreamt of stepping into a world that stretches beyond the horizons, a place larger than Earth itself? INFINITRA makes this dream a reality. Through the magic of virtual reality (VR), I invite you to explore endless expanses and discover territories without bounds. It's a passion project of mine, designed to let your curiosity roam free in an infinite structure.

## Explore the Unending Wonders of INFINITRA
The Birth of INFINITRA
What started as an impossible dream from my childhood became feasible in 2017, thanks to the rise of mainstream VR headsets. INFINITRA's journey began with a simple and slow cube rendering engine. Although the VR concept was working, the technology of the time couldn't keep up.
Fast forward to 2024, and we're at a turning point where the vision of INFINITRA can be fully realized, powered by the latest advancements in CPU and GPU technology.

Crafted with the Unity engine, INFINITRA harnesses the full potential of all CPU cores to create its intricate fractal geometry. I've implemented several techniques to minimize computational demands, such as fractal cell culling and optimizing mesh resolutions for distant objects. Moreover, the fractal universe of INFINITRA is dynamic, allowing the addition of non-fractal elements through specific search patterns.

## The Infinite Possibilities of INFINITRA
As of now, INFINITRA offers the freedom to wander endlessly. Yet, the vision for what it could evolve into is boundless. The future could hold anything from complex quests to collaborative creations. I'm always open to new ideas and would love to hear your thoughts on what INFINITRA could become.

## Availability: A Horizon Yet to Be Reached
The release date for INFINITRA remains uncertain. Whenever I have spare time, I'm working to bring this vision to life and will share updates as the journey progresses.

## Why a GitHub Space for INFINITRA?
You might wonder why I've set up a space for INFINITRA on GitHub. The answer is simple: collaboration. I believe in the power of community to accelerate innovation. This platform is an invitation for fellow dreamers and developers to join in refining and expanding this virtual universe.

INFINITRA is more than just a project; it's a testament to the power of imagination and technological advancement. Together, let's push the boundaries of virtual exploration.

## What are the Hardware requirements?
INFINITRA was developed on an AMD Ryzen 9 7900 12-Core CPU with a GeForce RTX 4060Ti OC GPU.
Currently there is only one default quality setting.
Optimizations for other systems and quality settings will be added in the future.

### Disclaimer(s)

Coming from Java/Python, you might notice some unconventional code styles and practices. Time constraints have also meant that some aspects, like class design and unit testing, could benefit from further refinement.
